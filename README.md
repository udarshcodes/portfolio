Hosted via GitHub Pages.

## About

This is my personal portfolio built to serve as a central hub for my skills, educational background, certifications, and hands-on projects. I built it to target recruiters and technical peers to demonstrate my competence in web development, machine learning, and cloud computing. The application is a frontend-only static site without a backend database.

## Features

- **Premium Glassmorphism UI:** Semi-transparent frosted-glass cards with subtle highlights and responsive drop shadows.
- **Dynamic Theming:** Toggle between dark and light themes using the navigation bar.
- **Interactive Background:** A network particle effect rendered on an HTML5 canvas that adapts to the active theme, with reduced-motion support for accessibility.
- **Tiered Projects Portfolio:** A structured three-tier architecture (Featured, Foundational, Labs) showcasing full-stack, AI, and hardware integrations.
- **Detailed Timelines:** Scroll through an academic and professional timeline detailing coursework, research internships, and core committee roles.
- **Categorized Skills:** Browse a grid of technical skills structured by domain (AI/ML, Frontend, Backend, Cloud).
- **Achievements & Certifications:** View major milestones, including the Nerds AI Quest Top 10 finish and Oracle/Microsoft certifications.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend Framework | React |
| Build Tool | Vite |
| Styling | Vanilla CSS / CSS Variables |
| Icons | react-icons, lucide-react |
| Animations | typewriter-effect, HTML5 Canvas |

## Architecture

The application is a single-page React frontend. The root `App.jsx` container manages the global light and dark theme state and passes it down. The `NetworkBackground` component operates an HTML5 Canvas to render a dynamic particle effect independent of the main content flow. The site is structured into distinct functional components—such as `Hero`, `About`, `Experience`, and `Projects`—that are sequentially rendered to create a cohesive, scrollable landing page.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/udarshcodes/personal_portfolio.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd personal_portfolio
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## What I learned or key decisions

- **Glassmorphism Design:** Achieved a highly premium "frosted glass" aesthetic using CSS `backdrop-filter: blur()`, semi-transparent `rgba` variables, and specular border highlights without relying on Tailwind or external libraries.
- **Custom Canvas Background:** Implemented the particle network effect natively using the HTML5 Canvas API instead of relying on heavy third-party libraries, keeping the bundle size small.
- **Accessibility:** Incorporated `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to gracefully disable animations and canvas effects for users with sensitivity to motion.
- **CSS Variables for Theming:** Used native CSS custom properties defined on the root element to handle dark and light modes, avoiding the need for CSS-in-JS libraries.
